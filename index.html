    My name is John and my hobby is hiking. I like hiking because I love being out in nature. It is also great exercise. I particularly like the fantastic scenery here in northern California.

    To enjoy hiking, one should probably have a good pair of hiking boots and socks. Don’t skimp on the boots. When shopping for hiking boots, wear them around the store for an hour to make sure you have a good fit. A good hiking shirt – one that wicks away the sweat – is a good investment. The best socks usually have some wool in them. You will also need a day pack, water bottle, insect repellant,  sunscreen, layered clothing, a sun hat and a map of the area where you will hike.

  Your first hikes should be planned in accordance with your fitness level. As you hike more, you will get into better shape and be able to do longer hikes with a wider range of elevations. You may also wish to subscribe to a hiking web site that helps you plan hikes with the most scenic routes. There are many meetup groups that are focused on hiking and the outdoors. You may also wish to integrate backpacking with your hiking adventures so as to go on longer hikes in more remote areas. You may also wish to acquire some hiking poles.
